Attention:  The Balsamiq Mockups recipes are currently using static links for updates.  I realize that this is counter intuitive to the purpose of using AutoPkg.  Balsamiq no longer uses a static update link and they do not have an update stream currently.

I have been updating the download link manually to avoid breaking people's autopkg automated environments, but ff they do not change this in the near future the recipes will be discontinued.
